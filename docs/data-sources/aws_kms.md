data "ciphertrust_aws_kms" "by_connection_name" {
  aws_connection = "connection name"
}

# To return details specific KMS
data "ciphertrust_aws_kms" "by_kms_name" {
  kms_name = "kms name"
}

# Create a key using details returned from the datasource
resource "ciphertrust_aws_key" "aws_key_by_kms_name" {
  customer_master_key_spec = "RSA_2048"
  kms                      = data.ciphertrust_aws_kms.by_kms_name.kms[0].kms_id
  key_usage                = "ENCRYPT_DECRYPT"
