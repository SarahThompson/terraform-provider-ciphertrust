# ciphertrust_cte_guardpoint (Resource)

This resource is used to create a CTE GuardPoint on a CTE Client. A GuardPoint specifies the list of folders that contains paths to be protected. Access to files and encryption of files under the GuardPoint is controlled by security policies.

A user can apply GuardPoint on specific path on a selected file server. It can be either on a directory, or on a raw device, it can be a applied on a cloud storage, and all these options will be driven by the "gp_type" parameter.

This resource is applicable to CipherTrust Manager only.
