# ciphertrust_oci_vault (Resource)

Use this resource to create and manage OCI vault resources in CipherTrust Manager.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Terraform Configuration for CipherTrust Provider

# This configuration demonstrates the creation of an OCI Vault resource
# with the CipherTrust provider

terraform {
  # Define the required providers for the configuration
  required_providers {
    # CipherTrust provider for managing CipherTrust Manager resources
    ciphertrust = {
      # The source of the provider
      source = "ThalesGroup/CipherTrust"
      # Version of the provider to use
      version = "1.0.0-pre3"
    }
  }
}

# Define an OCI connection
resource "ciphertrust_oci_connection" "connection" {
  key_file            = "path-to-or-contents-of-oci-key-file"
  name                = "example-name"
  pub_key_fingerprint = "public-key-fingerprint"
  region              = "oci-region"
  tenancy_ocid        = "tenancy-ocid"
  user_ocid           = "user-ocid"
}

# Define an OCI vault
resource "ciphertrust_oci_vault" "vault" {
  region        = "oci-region"
  connection_id = ciphertrust_oci_connection.connection.name
  vault_id      = "vault-ocid"
}

# Define an OCI vault, using available datasources

data "ciphertrust_get_oci_regions" "regions" {
  connection_id = ciphertrust_oci_connection.connection.name
}

data "ciphertrust_get_oci_compartments" "compartments" {
  connection_id = ciphertrust_oci_connection.connection.name
}

data "ciphertrust_get_oci_vaults" "vaults" {
  connection_id = ciphertrust_oci_connection.connection.name
  compartment_id = data.ciphertrust_get_oci_compartments.compartments.compartments.0.id
  region         = data.ciphertrust_get_oci_regions.regions.oci_regions.0
}

resource "ciphertrust_oci_vault" "vault" {
  region        = data.ciphertrust_get_oci_regions.regions.oci_regions.0
  connection_id = ciphertrust_oci_connection.connection.name
  vault_id      = data.ciphertrust_get_oci_vaults.vaults.vaults.0.vault_id
}

# Import an existing OCI vault

## Define a resource for an existing vault with values matching the vault
resource "ciphertrust_oci_vault" "imported_vault" {
  region        = "region"
  connection_id = "connection-name"
  vault_id      = "vault_ocid"
}

## Run the terraform import command
terraform import ciphertrust_oci_vault.imported_vault ciphertrust-manager-oci-vault-resource-id
For example: terraform import ciphertrust_oci_vault.imported_vault af0c0c2c-242f-4c23-ab82-76d32d54901b
```

## Schema

### Required

- `connection_id` (String) CipherTrust Manager OCI connection ID or connection name. When importing an existing vault use connection name.
- `region` (String) OCI region.
- `vault_id` (String) Vault OCID.

### Optional

- `bucket_name` (String) Name of the OCI bucket for creating key backups of HSM-protected keys for Virtual Private Vaults (VPVs). The bucket should be in the same region as the vault. You must have appropriate read/write permissions on this bucket. Note: If bucket_name is not specified, the keys cannot be backed up while syncing vaults.
- `bucket_namespace` (String) Namespace of the OCI bucket, bucket_name. This parameter is required if bucket_name is specified. Note: If bucket_namespace is not specified, the keys cannot be backed up while syncing vaults.

### Read-Only

- `account` (String) The account which owns this resource.
- `acls` (Attributes Set) List of ACLs that have been added to the vault. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--acls))
- `cloud_name` (String) Cloud name.
- `compartment_id` (String) Compartment OCID.
- `compartment_name` (String) Compartment name.
- `created_at` (String) Date/time the application was created
- `defined_tags` (Attributes List) Defined tags for the key. A tag consists of namespace, key, and value. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--defined_tags))
- `freeform_tags` (Map of String) Freeform tags for the key. A freeform tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the resource.
- `is_primary` (Boolean) True if a primary vault.
- `lifecycle_state` (String) Current state of the vault.
- `name` (String) Vault name.
- `refreshed_at` (String) Date/time the application was refreshed.
- `replication_id` (String) OCI replication ID.
- `restored_from_vault_id` (String) OCID of the vault this vault was restored from.
- `tenancy` (String) Tenancy name.
- `time_created` (String) OCI Vault type.
- `updated_at` (String) Date/time the application was updated.
- `uri` (String) A human-readable unique identifier of the resource.
- `vault_type` (String) OCI Vault type.
